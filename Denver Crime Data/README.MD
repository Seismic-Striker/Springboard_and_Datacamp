# Denver Crime Data

The City of Denver shares it's crime data online for it's citizen and the public record. The data provided online begins Jan 1, 2017 to the end of February 2022. Using this data the goal is to determine what the COVID-19 Epidemic did to the crime rates in the city, and see if there is a way to take the data and create a predictive model for the type of crime committed.
