# Denver Crime Data

The City of Denver shares it's crime data online for it's citizen and the public record. The data provided online begins Jan 1, 2017 to the end of February 2022. Using this data the goal is to determine what the COVID-19 Epidemic did to the crime rates in the city, and see if there is a way to take the data and create a predictive model for the type of crime committed. 

In [Denver Crime Data Wrangling.ipynb](https://github.com/Seismic-Striker/Springboard_and_Datacamp/blob/main/Denver%20Crime%20Data/Denver%20Crime%20Data%20Wrangling.ipynb), we gather the data, organize it, get rid of nulls, and join it on a column to two other data sources. 

In [Denver Crime EDA.ipynb](https://github.com/Seismic-Striker/Springboard_and_Datacamp/blob/main/Denver%20Crime%20Data/Denver%20Crime%20EDA.ipynb), we analyze the data in the data set, create visualisations and time series analysis.

In [DC_pre_processing.ipynb](https://github.com/Seismic-Striker/Springboard_and_Datacamp/blob/main/Denver%20Crime%20Data/DC_pre_processing.ipynb), we prepare the data for Machine Learning Methods, simplifying some categorical values, feature engineering, and creating multiple testing subsets.

In [Modeling.ipynb](https://github.com/Seismic-Striker/Springboard_and_Datacamp/blob/main/Denver%20Crime%20Data/Modeling.ipynb) we model the data using 6 different machine learning methods
