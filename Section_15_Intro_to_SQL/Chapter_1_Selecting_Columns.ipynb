    "Hi, and welcome to Introduction to SQL for Data Science! Most of the world's data live in databases, so learning how to access and unlock insights from these data is an essential skill for every data scientist. SQL, or ess-que-el, is the native language for interacting with databases and is designed for exactly this purpose. This course will give you a basic introduction to SQL. We hope you enjoy it.\n",
