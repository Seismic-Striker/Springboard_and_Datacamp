    "You've written your very own Python functions using the def keyword, function headers, docstrings and function bodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Lambda functions\n",
    "There's a quicker way to write functions on the fly and these are called lambda functions because you use the keyword lambda. Here we re-write our function raise_to_power as a lambda function. To do so, after the keyword lambda, we specify the names of the arguments; then we use a colon followed by the expression that specifies what we wish the function to return. Lambda functions allow you to write functions in a quick and potentially dirty way so I wouldn't advise you to use them all the time but there are situations when they can come in very handy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Anonymous functions\n",
    "For example, check out the map function, which takes two arguments, a function and a sequence such as a list and applies the function over all elements of the sequence. We can pass lambda functions to map without even naming them and in this case we refer to them as anonymous functions. In this example, we use map on a lambda function that squares all elements of a list and we'll store the result in square_all. Printing square_all reveals that it is actually a map object so to see what it contains we use the function list to turn it into a list and print the results to the shell. As expected, it's a list containing the squares of the elements in the original list!\n",

In this case, it threw me a ValueError and there are many types of errors.\n",

    "# 1. Congratulations!\n",
    "Well done. You're now well on your way to being a Pythonista Data Science ninja.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What you’ve learned:\n",
    "You're now able to write functions in Python that accept single and multiple arguments and can return as many values as you please. You're also adept at using default and flexible arguments and keyword arguments. You've gained insight into scoping in Python, can write lambda functions and handle errors in your very own function writing practice. You've also gained invaluable practice in using all of these techniques to write functions that are useful in a Data Science context. You have come a long way in your developing practice as a budding Pythonista Data Scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. There’s more to learn!\n",
    "There are more basic skills that you will need to learn in Python to be valuable as a working Data Scientist and many of these we'll cover in the sequel to this course so if you're finding yourself still thirsty for more Pythonista Data Science chops, I'd head over there right now. There you'll learn all about list comprehensions, which allow you to wrangle data in lists to create other lists, a tool utilized by all Data Scientists working in Python. You'll also learn about iterators, which you have already seen in the context of for loops without having necessarily known it. Iterators are everywhere in PythonLand and, to put it simply, allow you to rapidly iterate Data Science protocols and procedures over sets of objects; these are a couple of the cool functionalities in PythonLand you'll encounter in the sequel to this course, which will conclude with an entire chapter devoted to a case study in which you'll apply time and time again techniques learnt in both of these courses.\n",
