    "At this point, you should have a firm idea of what your data science problem is and have the data you believe could help solve it. The business problem was a general one of modeling resort revenue. The data you started with contained some ticket price values, but with a number of missing values that led to several rows being dropped completely. You also had two kinds of ticket price. There were also some obvious issues with some of the other features in the data that, for example, led to one column being completely dropped, a data error corrected, and some other rows dropped. You also obtained some additional US state population and size data with which to augment the dataset, which also required some cleaning.\n",

    "New York dominates the area of skiing available at night. Looking at the top five in general, they are all the more northerly states. Is night skiing in and of itself an appeal to customers, or is a consequence of simply trying to extend the skiing day where days are shorter? Is New York's domination here because it's trying to maximize its appeal to visitors who'd travel a shorter distance for a shorter visit? You'll find the data generates more (good) questions rather than answering them. This is a positive sign! You might ask your executive sponsor or data provider for some additional data about typical length of stays at these resorts, although you might end up with data that is very granular and most likely proprietary to each resort. A useful level of granularity might be \"number of day tickets\" and \"number of weekly passes\" sold."

The season will only be so long, and so the more resorts open through the skiing season, the more total days open we'll see.

    "There are big states which are not necessarily the most populous. There are states that host many resorts, but other states host a larger total skiing area. The states with the most total days skiing per season are not necessarily those with the most resorts. And New York State boasts an especially large night skiing area. New York had the most resorts but wasn't in the top five largest states, so the reason for it having the most resorts can't be simply having lots of space for them. New York has the second largest population behind California. Perhaps many resorts have sprung up in New York because of the population size? Does this mean there is a high competition between resorts in New York State, fighting for customers and thus keeping prices down? You're not concerned, per se, with the absolute size or population of a state, but you could be interested in the ratio of resorts serving a given population or a given area.\n",

This technique will find linear combinations of the original features that are uncorrelated with one another and order them by the amount of variance they explain. You can use these derived features to visualize the data in a lower dimension (e.g. 2 down from 7) and know how much variance the representation explains.

Ticket price may drop a little before then climbing upwards as the number of resorts per capita increases. Ticket price could climb with the number of resorts serving a population because it indicates a popular area for skiing with plenty of demand. The lower ticket price when fewer resorts serve a population may similarly be because it's a less popular state for skiing.

Was there any pattern suggested of a relationship between state and ticket price? What did this lead us to decide regarding which features to use in subsequent modeling? What aspects of the data (e.g. relationships between features) should you remain wary of when you come to perform feature selection for modeling? Two key points that must be addressed are the choice of target feature for your modelling and how, if at all, you're going to handle the states labels in the data."
