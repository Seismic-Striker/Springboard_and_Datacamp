    "# 1. Welcome to the course!\n",
    "Hi, my name is Chester Ismay and I'll be your instructor for this course on Joining Data in PostgreSQL. As the name suggests, the focus of this course is using SQL to join two or more database tables together into a single table, an essential skill for data scientists. In this chapter, you'll learn about the INNER JOIN, which along with LEFT JOIN are probably the two most common JOINs. You'll see diagrams throughout this course that are designed to help you understand the mechanics of the different joins. Let's begin with a diagram showing the layout of some data and then how an INNER JOIN can be applied to that data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Initial data diagram\n",
    "In the videos in this chapter and the next, we'll often work with two tables named left and right. You can see that matching values of the id field are colored with the same color. The id field is known as a KEY field since it can be used to reference one table to another. Both the left and right tables also have another field named val. This will be useful in helping you see specifically which records and values are included in each join.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. INNER JOIN diagram\n",
    "An INNER JOIN only includes records in which the key is in both tables. You can see here that the id field matches for values of 1 and 4 only. With inner joins we look for matches in the right table corresponding to all entries in the key field in the left table.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. INNER JOIN diagram (2)\n",
    "So the focus here shifts to only those records with a match in terms of the id field. The records not of interest to INNER JOIN have been faded.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. INNER JOIN diagram (3)\n",
    "Here's a resulting single table from the INNER JOIN clause that gives the val field from the right table with records corresponding to only those with id value of 1 or 4, which are colored as yellow and purple. Now that you have a sense for how INNER JOIN works, let's try an example in SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. prime_ministers table\n",
    "The prime_ministers table is one of the tables in the leaders database. It is displayed here. Note the countries that are included. Suppose you were interested in determining nations that have both a prime minister and a president AND putting the results into a single table. Next you'll see the presidents table.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. presidents table\n",
    "How did I display all of the prime_ministers table in the previous slide? Recall the use of SELECT and FROM clauses as is shown for the presidents table here. Which countries appear in both tables? With small tables like these, it is easy to notice that Egypt, Portugal, Vietnam, and Haiti appear in both tables. For larger tables, it isn't as simple as just picking these countries out visually. So what does the syntax look like for SQL to get the results of countries with a prime minister and a president from these two tables into one?\n",
    "\n",
    "8. INNER JOIN in SQL\n",
    "The syntax for completing an INNER JOIN from the prime_ministers table to the presidents table based on a key field of country is shown. Note the use of aliases for prime_ministers as p1 and presidents as p2. This helps to simplify your code, especially with longer table names like prime_ministers and presidents. A SELECT statement is used to select specific fields from the two tables. In this case, since country exists in both tables, we must write p1 and the period to avoid a SQL error. Next we list the table on the left of the inner join after FROM and then we list the table on the right after INNER JOIN. Lastly, we specify the keys in the two tables that we would like to match on.\n",
