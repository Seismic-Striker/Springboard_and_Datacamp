    "# 1. Why do missing values exist?\n",
    "In the first chapter, we looked at the different types of data one may find when analyzing data. In this lesson, we will explore the concept of messy and missing values, how to find them, and once identified, how to deal with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. How gaps in data occur\n",
    "While in an ideal world every dataset you come across would be perfectly complete and contain no gaps, unfortunately, this is rarely the case. Real world data often has noise or omissions. This can stem from many sources, for example: Data not being collected properly (paper surveys not being filled out fully). Collection and management errors (someone transcribing the data making a mistake). Data intentionally being omitted (people may want to skip the age box in an online form). Or gaps could be created due to transformations of the data (average of a field with missing data). This list is far from comprehensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Why we care?\n",
    "You may wonder why are we discussing this? Does missing data even matter? Yes, it does, and it is extremely important to identify and deal with missing data. Many machine learning models cannot work with missing values, for example if you were performing linear regression, you would need a value for every row and column used in your dataset. Missing data may be indicative of a problem in your data pipeline. If data is consistently missing in a certain column, you should investigate as to why this is the case. Missing data may provide information in itself. For example, if the number of children of a person is missing they may have no children.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Missing value discovery\n",
    "You can use the info() method to have a preliminary look at how complete the dataset is. Right from the get go you can see that the StackOverflowJobsRecommend, Gender, and RawSalary columns are highly underpopulated and we should examine where these missing values occur. This list output is useful but becomes limited with larger datasets that have missing values scattered all over their features.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finding missing values\n",
    "To find where these missing values exist, you can use the isnull() method as shown here. All cells where missing values exist are shown as True.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finding missing values\n",
    "You can also count the number of missing values in a specific column by chaining the isnull() and sum() methods as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Finding non-missing values\n",
    "The inverse (or the non missing values) can also be found using the notnull() method. Here, all missing values are shown as False. Note that you can call the isnull() and notnull() methods on both the DataFrame as a whole, and on each of it's individual columns.\n",

    "1. Dealing with missing values (I)\n",
    "Now that you can recognize why missing values occur and how to locate them, you need to know how they can be dealt with.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Listwise deletion\n",
    "If you are confident that the missing values in your dataset are occurring at random, (in other words not being intentionally omitted) the most effective and statistically sound approach to dealing with them is called 'complete case analysis' or listwise deletion. In this method, a record is fully excluded from your model if any of its values are missing. Take for example the dataset shown here. Although most of the information is available in the first and third rows, because values in the ConvertedSalary column are missing, these rows will be dropped.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Listwise deletion in Python\n",
    "To implement listwise deletion using pandas, you can use the dropna() method, by setting the how argument to 'any'. This will delete all rows with at least one missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Listwise deletion in Python\n",
    "On the other hand, if you want to delete rows with missing values in only a specific column, you can use the subset argument. Pass a list of columns to this argument to specify which columns to consider when deleting rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Issues with deletion\n",
    "While the preferable approach in situations where missing data occurs purely at random is listwise deletion, it does have its drawbacks. First, it deletes perfectly valid data points that share a row with a missing value. Second, if the missing values do not occur entirely at random it can negatively affect the model. Lastly, if you were to remove a feature instead of a row it can reduce the degrees of freedom of your model.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Replacing with strings\n",
    "The most common way to deal with missing values is to simply fill these values using the fillna() method. To use the fillna() method on a specific column, you need to provide the value you want to replace the missing values with. In the case of categorical columns, it is common to replace missing values with strings like 'Other', 'Not Given' etc. To replace the missing values in place, in other words to modify the original DataFrame, you need to set the inplace argument to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Recording missing values\n",
    "In situations where you believe that the absence or presence of data is more important than the values themselves, you can create a new column that records the absence of data and then drop the original column. To do this, all you need to do is call the notnull() method on a specific column. This will output a list of True/False values, thus recording the presence/absence of data. To drop columns from a DataFrame, you can use the drop() method and specify a list of column names which you want to drop as the columns argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Practice time\n",
    "With this in mind you will now work through applying listwise deletion, and some alternatives for replacing missing values in categorical columns."

    "2. Bad characters\n",
    "For example, lets look at the data type of the RawSalary column. It's an object, although intuitively, you know that it should be numeric. So why is that?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bad characters\n",
    "Let's take a quick peek at the data. Numeric columns should not contain any non-numeric characters. So you need to remove these commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Dealing with bad characters\n",
    "Although you want the column to be a numeric column, it is of type object, which means you can use string methods to fix this column. In this case, we want to remove all occurrences of comma. We can easily achieve this by accessing the str accessor and using the replace() method. The first argument is the string you want to replace, which is the comma, and the second argument is the string you want to replace it with, which here is an empty string, which simply means you want to remove all the commas. However, the data type of this column is still object. Now you can convert your column to the relevant type as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Finding other stray characters\n",
    "But what if attempting to change the data type raises an error? This may indicate that there are additional stray characters which you didn't account for. Instead of manually searching for values with other stray characters you can use the to_numeric() function from pandas along with the errors argument. If you set the errors argument to 'coerce', Pandas will convert the column to numeric, but all values that can't be converted to numeric will be changed to NaNs, that is missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Finding other stray characters\n",
    "You can now use the isna() method like you did earlier to find out which values failed to parse. So it looks like we also have dollar signs. You can again use the replace() method as before to remove the dollar signs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Chaining methods\n",
    "Before you get going onto trying these for yourself, it will be useful to delve a little deeper into method chaining. If you are applying different methods or in fact the same method several times on a column, instead of assigning the result back to the column after each iteration, you can simply chain the methods, that is, call one method after the other to obtain the desired result. For example, cleaning up characters, changing the data type, normalizing the values etc. can all be achieved by simply calling the methods one after the other as seen here.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Go ahead and fix bad characters!\n",
    "Now that you know how to deal with stray characters, let's put it into practice."
