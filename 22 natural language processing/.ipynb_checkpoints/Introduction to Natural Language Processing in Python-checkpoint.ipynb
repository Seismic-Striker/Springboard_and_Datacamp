    "Welcome to the course! In this video, you'll be learning about regular expressions.\n",

    "2. What is Natural Language Processing?\n",
    "Natural language processing is a massive field of study and actively used practice which aims to make sense of language using statistics and computers. In this course, you will learn some of the basics of NLP which will help you move from simple to more difficult and advanced topics. Even though this is the first course, you will still get some exposure to the challenges of the field such as topic identification and text classification. Some interesting NLP areas you might have heard about are: topic identification, chatbots, text classification, translation, sentiment analysis. There are also many more! You will learn the fundamentals of some of these topics as we move through the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What exactly are regular expressions?\n",
    "Regular expressions are strings you can use that have a special syntax, which allows you to match patterns and find other strings. A pattern is a series of letters or symbols which can map to an actual text or words or punctuation. You can use regular expressions to do things like find links in a webpage, parse email addresses and remove unwanted strings or characters. Regular expressions are often referred to as regex and can be used easily with python via the `re` library. Here we have a simple import of the library. We can match a substring by using the re.match method which matches a pattern with a string. It takes the pattern as the first argument, the string as the second and returns a match object, here we see it matched exactly what we expected: abc. We can also use special patterns that regex understands, like the \\w+ which will match a word. We can see here via the match object representation that it has matched the first word it found -- hi.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Common regex patterns\n",
    "There are hundreds of characters and patterns you can learn and memorize with regular expressions, but to get started, I want to share a few common patterns. The first pattern \\w we already saw, it is used to match words. The \\d pattern allows us to match digits, which can be useful when you need to find them and separate them in a string. The \\s pattern matches spaces, the period is a wildcard character. The wildcard will match ANY letter or symbol. The + and * characters allow things to become greedy, grabbing repeats of single letters or whole patterns. For example to match a full word rather than one character, we need to add the + symbol after the \\w. Using these character classes as capital letters negates them so the \\S matches anything that is not a space. You can also create a group of characters you want by putting them inside square brackets, like our lowercase group.\n",

    "11. Python's re module\n",
    "In the following exercises, you'll use the `re` module to perform some simple activities, like splitting on a pattern or finding all patterns in a string. In addition to split and findall, search and match are also quite popular. You saw a simple match at the beginning of this video, and search is similar but doesn't require you to match the pattern from the beginning of the string. The syntax for the regex library is always to pass the pattern first, and the string second. Depending on the method, it may return an iterator, a new string or a match object. Here we see the re.split method will take a pattern for spaces and a string with some spaces and return a list object with the results of splitting on spaces. This can be used for tokenization, so you can preprocess text using regex while doing natural language processing.\n",

    "# 1. Introduction to tokenization\n",
    "In this video, we'll learn more about string tokenization!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is tokenization?\n",
    "Tokenization is the process of transforming a string or document into smaller chunks, which we call tokens. This is usually one step in the process of preparing a text for natural language processing. There are many different theories and rules regarding tokenization, and you can create your own tokenization rules using regular expresssions, but normally tokenization will do things like break out words or sentences, often separate punctuation or you can even just tokenize parts of a string like separating all hashtags in a Tweet.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. nltk library\n",
    "One library that is commonly used for simple tokenization is nltk, the natural language toolkit library. Here is a short example of using the word_tokenize method to break down a string into tokens. We can see from the result that words are separated and punctuation are individual tokens as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Why tokenize?\n",
    "Why bother with tokenization? Because it can help us with some simple text processing tasks like mapping part of speech, matching common words and perhaps removing unwanted tokens like common words or repeated words. Here, we have a good example. The sentence is: I don't like Sam's shoes. When we tokenize it we can clearly see the negation in the not and we can see possession with the 's. These indicators can help us determine meaning from simple text.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Other nltk tokenizers\n",
    "Beyond just tokenizing words, NLTK has plenty of other tokenizers you can use, including these ones you'll be working with in this chapter. The sent_tokenize function will split a document into individual sentences. The regexp_tokenize uses regular expressions to tokenize the string, giving you more granular control over the process. And the tweettokenizer does neat things like recognize hashtags, mentions and when you have too many punctuation symbols following a sentence. How convenient!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. More regex practice\n",
    "You'll be using more regex in this section as well, not only when you are tokenizing, but also figuring out how to parse tokens and text. Using the regex module's re.match and re.search are pretty essential tools for Python string processing. Learning when to use search versus match can be challenging, so let's take a look at how they are different. When we use search and match with the same pattern and string with the pattern is at the beginning of the string, we see we find identical matches. That is the case with matching and searching abcde with the pattern abc. When we use search for a pattern that appears later in the string we get a result, but we don't get the same result using match. This is because match will try and match a string from the beginning until it cannot match any longer. Search will go through the ENTIRE string to look for match options. If you need to find a pattern that might not be at the beginning of the string, you should use search. If you want to be specific about the composition of the entire string, or at least the initial pattern, then you should use match.\n",

    "2. Regex groups using or \"|\"\n",
    "One new regex pattern you will find useful for advanced tokenization is the ability to use the or method. In regex, OR is represented by the pipe character. To use the or, you can define a group using parenthesis. Groups can be either a pattern or a set of characters you want to match. You can also define explicit character classes using square brackets. We'll go a bit more into depth on groups and ranges soon. Let's take an example that we want to tokenize using regular expressions and we want to find all digits and words. We define our pattern using a group with the OR symbol and make them greedy so they catch the full word or digits. Then, we can call findall using Python's re library and return our tokens. Notice that our pattern does not match punctuation but properly matches the words and digits.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Regex ranges and groups\n",
    "Let's take a look at another more advanced topic, defining groups and character ranges. Here we have another chart of patterns, and this time we are using ranges or character classes marked by the square brackets and groups marked by the parentheses. We can see in this chart that we can use square brackets to define a new character class. For example, we can match all upper and lowercase english letters using Uppercase A hyphen Uppercase Z which will match all uppercase and then lowercase a hyphen lowercase z which will match all lowercase letters. We can also make ranges to match all digits 0 hyphen 9, or perhaps a more complex range like uppercase and lowercase English with the hyphen and period. Because the hyphen and period are special characters in regex, we must tell regex we mean an ACTUAL period or hyphen. To do so, we use what is called an escape character and in regex that means to place a backwards slash in front of our character so it knows then to look for a hyphen or period. On the other hand, with groups which are designated by the parentheses, we can only match what we explicitly define in the group. So a-z matched only a, a hyphen and z. Groups are useful when you want to define an explicit group, such as the final example; where we are taking spaces or commas.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Character range with `re.match()`\n",
    "In this code example, we can use match with a character range to match all lowercase ascii, any digits and spaces. It is greedy marked by the + after the range definition, but once it hits the comma, it can't match anymore. This short example demonstrates that thinking about what regex method you use (such as search versus match) and whether you define a group or a range can have a large impact on the usefulness and readability of your patterns.\n",

    "1. Charting word length with nltk\n",
    "Hi everyone! In this video, we are going to learn about using charts with our NLP tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Getting started with matplotlib\n",
    "Matplotlib is a charting library used by many different open-source Python projects to create data visualizations, charts and graphs. It has fairly straightforward functionality with lots of options for graphs like histograms, bar charts, line charts and scatter plots. It even has advanced functionality like generating 3D graphs and animations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Plotting a histogram with matplotlib\n",
    "Matplotlib is usually imported by simply aliasing the pyplot module as plt. If we want to plot a basic histogram, which is a type of plot used to show distribution of data, we can pass in a small array to the `hist` function. The array has 5 appearing twice and 7 appearing three times, so it's a good candidate to show distribution. Finally, we call the plt.show function and matplotlib will show us the generated chart in our system's standard graphics viewing tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Generated histogram\n",
    "This is the chart that we generated using the previous code. We notice that indeed it has determined proper bins for each entry and we can see that the 7 and 5 bins reflect the distribution we expected to see. It's not the prettiest chart by default, but making it look nicer is fairly easy with more arguments and several available helper libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Combining NLP data extraction with plotting\n",
    "We can then use skills we have learned throughout this first chapter to tokenize text and chart word length for a simple sentence. First, we perform the necessary imports to use NLTK for word tokenization and matplotlib charting. Then, we tokenize the words and punctuation in a short sentence. Finally, we can use Python list comprehension with our tokenized words array to transform it to a list of lengths. As a brief refresher on list comprehensions, it is a succint way to write a for loop. If we look at the syntax, we have opening and closing square brackets. Then we can iterate over any list and make a new list using this simple syntax. Here, we create a list that holds the lengths of each word in the words array simply by saying len(w) for w in words. This will iterate over each word, calculate the length and return it as a new list. We then pass this array of token lengths to the hist function and generate our chart using the plt.show method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Word length histogram\n",
    "Here is the generated histogram from our previous code. We can see from the chart that we have a majority of four-letter words in our example sentence. Of course, with a simple sentence, this is easy enough to simply count by hand -- but for an entire play or book, this would be tedious and prone to error -- so writing it in code makes it a lot easier.\n",
    "\n",

They could be carried.\\nSOLDIER #1: What?  A swallow carrying a coconut?\\nARTHUR: It could grip it by the husk!\\nSOLDIER #1: It's not a question of where he grips it!  It's a simple question of weight ratios!  A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.\\nARTHUR: Well, it doesn't matter.  Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here.\\nSOLDIER #1: Listen.  In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?\\nARTHUR: Please!\\nSOLDIER #1: Am I right?\\nARTHUR: I'm not interested!\\nSOLDIER #2: It could be carried by an African swallow!\\nSOLDIER #1: Oh, yeah, an African swallow maybe, but not a European swallow.

I would be honored.\\nARTHUR: What is your name?\\nBEDEVERE: Bedevere, my liege.\\nARTHUR: Then I dub you Sir Bedevere, Knight of the Round Table\\nNARRATOR: The wise Sir Bedevere was the first to join King Arthur's knights, but other illustrious names were soon to follow: Sir Lancelot the Brave; Sir Gallahad the Pure; and Sir Robin the-not-quite-so-brave-as-Sir-Lancelot, who had nearly fought the Dragon of Angnor, who had nearly stood up to the vicious Chicken of Bristol, and who had personally wet himself at the Battle of Badon Hill; and the aptly named Sir Not-appearing-in-this-film.  Together they formed a band whose names and deeds were to be retold throughout the centuries: the Knights of the Round Table\\nSCENE 6: [clop clop clop] \\nSIR BEDEVERE: And that, my liege, is how we know the earth to be banana-shaped.\\nARTHUR: This new learning amazes me, Sir Bedevere.  Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.\\nBEDEVERE: Oh, certainly, sir.\\nSIR LAUNCELOT: Look, my liege! [trumpets] \\nARTHUR: Camelot!\\nSIR GALAHAD: Camelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Camelot!\\nPATSY: It's only a model.\\nARTHUR: Shh!  Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.  Let us ride... to...  Camelot! [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [singing] We're knights of the round table.  We dance when e'er we're able.  We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable.  We dine well here in Camelot.  We eat ham and jam and spam a lot [dancing] We're knights of the Round Table. Our shows are formidable, But many times we're given rhymes That are quite unsingable. We're opera mad in Camelot. We sing from the diaphragm a lot [in dungeon] \\nPRISONER: [clap clap clap clap] [in medieval hall] \\nKNIGHTS: [tap-dancing] In war we're tough and able, Quite indefatigable.  Between our quests we sequin vests and impersonate Clark Gable.  It's a busy life in Camelot.\\nMAN: I have to push the pram a lot [outdoors] \\nARTHUR: Well, on second thought, let's not go to Camelot.  It is a silly place.\\nKNIGHTS: Right.  Right\\nSCENE 7: [clop clop clop] [boom boom] [angels sing] \\nGOD: Arthur!  Arthur, King of the Britons!  Oh, don't grovel! [singing stops] One thing I can't stand, it's people groveling.\\nARTHUR: Sorry. [boom] \\nGOD: And don't apologise.  Every time I try to talk to someone it's 'sorry this' and 'forgive me that' and 'I'm not worthy'. [boom] What are you doing now?!\\nARTHUR: I'm averting my eyes, O Lord.\\nGOD: Well, don't.  It's like those miserable Psalms-- they're so depressing. Now knock it off!\\nARTHUR: Yes, Lord.\\nGOD: Right!  Arthur, King of the Britons, your Knights of the Round Table shall have a task to make them an example in these dark times.\\nARTHUR: Good idea, O Lord!\\nGOD: 'Course it's a good idea!  Behold! [angels sing] Arthur, this is the Holy Grail.  Look well, Arthur, for it is your sacred task to seek this grail.  That is your purpose, Arthur...  the quest for the Holy Grail. [boom] [singing stops] \\nLAUNCELOT: A blessing!  A blessing from the Lord!\\nGALAHAD: God be praised\\nSCENE 8: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] \\nARTHUR: Halt! [horn] Hallo! [pause] Hallo!\\nFRENCH GUARD: Allo!  Who is eet?\\nARTHUR: It is King Arthur, and these are my Knights of the Round Table.  Who's castle is this?\\nFRENCH GUARD: This is the castle of my master Guy de Loimbard.\\nARTHUR: Go and tell your master that we have been charged by God with a sacred quest.  If he will give us food and shelter for the night he can join us in our quest for the Holy Grail.\\nFRENCH GUARD: Well, I'll ask him, but I don't think he'll be very keen.  Uh, he's already got one, you see?\\nARTHUR: What?\\nGALAHAD: He says they've already got one!\\nARTHUR: Are you sure he's got one?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Oh, yes, it's very nice-a.  (I told him we already got one.)\\nARTHUR: Well, u-- um, can we come up and have a look?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Of course not!  You are English types-a!\\nARTHUR: Well, what are you then?\\nFRENCH GUARD: I'm French!  Why do think I have this outrageous accent, you silly king-a?!\\nGALAHAD: What are you doing in England?\\nFRENCH GUARD: Mind your own business!\\nARTHUR: If you will not show us the Grail, we shall take your castle by force!\\nFRENCH GUARD: You don't frighten us, English pig-dogs!  Go and boil your bottom, sons of a silly person.  I blow my nose at you, so-called Arthur King, you and all your silly English k-nnnnniggets.  Thpppppt!  Thppt! Thppt!\\nGALAHAD: What a strange person.\\nARTHUR: Now look here, my good man--\\nFRENCH GUARD: I don't wanna talk to you no more, you empty headed animal food trough wiper!  I fart in your general direction!  You mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!\\nGALAHAD: Is there someone else up there we could talk to?\\nFRENCH GUARD: No, now go away or I shall taunt you a second time-a! [sniff] \\nARTHUR: Now, this is your last chance.  I've been more than reasonable.\\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache.)\\nOTHER FRENCH GUARD: Quoi?\\nFRENCH GUARD: (Fetchez la vache!) [mooo] \\nARTHUR: If you do not agree to my commands, then I shall-- [twong] [mooooooo] Jesus Christ!\\nKNIGHTS: Christ! [thud] Ah!  Ohh!\\nARTHUR: Right!  Charge!\\nKNIGHTS: Charge!

Not only by surprise, but totally unarmed!\\nARTHUR: Who leaps out?\\nBEDEVERE: U-- u-- uh, Launcelot, Galahad, and I.  Uh, leap out of the rabbit, uh, and uh...\\nARTHUR: Ohh.\\nBEDEVERE: Oh.

The ferocity of the French taunting took him completely by surprise, and Arthur became convinced that a new strategy was required if the quest for the Holy Grail were to be brought to a successful conclusion.  Arthur, having consulted his closest knights, decided that they should separate, and search for the Grail individually. [clop clop clop] Now, this is what they did: Launcelot--\\nKNIGHT: Aaaah! [slash] [KNIGHT kills HISTORIAN] \\nHISTORIAN'S WIFE: Frank\\nSCENE 10: [trumpets] \\nNARRATOR: The Tale of Sir Robin.  So each of the knights went their separate ways.  Sir Robin rode north, through the dark forest of Ewing, accompanied by his favorite minstrels.\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely bold Sir Robin, rode forth from Camelot.  He was not afraid to die, O brave Sir Robin.  He was not at all afraid to be killed in nasty ways.  Brave, brave, brave, brave Sir Robin!  He was not in the least bit scared to be mashed into a pulp, Or to have his eyes gouged out, and his elbows broken.  To have his kneecaps split, and his body burned away, And his limbs all hacked and mangled, brave Sir Robin!\\nHis head smashed in and his heart cut out, And his liver removed and his bowels unplugged, And his nostrils raped and his bottom burned off, And his pen--\\nSIR ROBIN: That's-- that's, uh-- that's enough music for now, lads.  Heh.  Looks like there's dirty work afoot.\\nDENNIS: Anarcho-syndicalism is a way of preserving freedom.\\nWOMAN: Oh, Dennis, forget about freedom.  We haven't got enough mud.\\nALL HEADS: Halt!  Who art thou?\\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is brave Sir Robin, brave Sir Robin, who--\\nROBIN: Shut up!  Um, n-- n-- n-- nobody really, I'm j-- j-- j-- ju-- just um, just passing through.\\nALL HEADS: What do you want?\\nMINSTREL: [singing] To fight and--\\nROBIN: Shut up!

W-- well, actually I-- I am a Knight of the Round Table.\\nALL HEADS: You're a Knight of the Round Table?\\nROBIN: I am.\\nLEFT HEAD: In that case I shall have to kill you.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Shall I?\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, I don't think so.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well, what do I think?\\nLEFT HEAD: I think kill him.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, let's be nice to him.\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh shut up.\\nROBIN: Perhaps I could--\\nLEFT HEAD: And you.  Oh, quick!  Get the sword out.  I want to cut his headoff!\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, cut your own head off!\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes, do us all a favor!\\nLEFT HEAD: What?\\nRIGHT HEAD: Yapping on all the time.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: You're lucky.  You're not next to him.\\nLEFT HEAD: What do you mean?\\nMIDDLE HEAD: You snore!\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, I don't.  Anyway, you've got bad breath.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Well it's only because you don't brush my teeth.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh stop bitching and let's go have tea.\\nLEFT HEAD: Oh, all right.  All right.  All right.  We'll kill him first and then have tea and biscuits.\\nMIDDLE HEAD: Yes.\\nRIGHT HEAD: Oh, not biscuits.\\nLEFT HEAD: All right.  All right, not biscuits, but let's kill him anyway.\\nALL HEADS: Right!\\nMIDDLE HEAD: He buggered off.\\nRIGHT HEAD: So he has.  He's scarper\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Brave Sir Robin ran away.\\nROBIN: No!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravely ran away away.\\nROBIN: I didn't!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] When danger reared its ugly head, he bravely turned his tail and fled.\\nROBIN: No!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Yes, brave Sir Robin turned about\\nROBIN: I didn't!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] And gallantly he chickened out, bravely taking to his feet.\\nROBIN: I never did!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] He beat a very brave retreat.\\nROBIN: All lies!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Bravest of the brave, Sir Robin.\\nROBIN: I never\\nCARTOON MONKS: [chanting] Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Heh heh heeh ooh...

Welcome to the Castle Anthrax.\\nGALAHAD: The Castle Anthrax?\\nZOOT: Yes.  Oh, it's not a very good name is it?  Oh, but we are nice and we will attend to your every, every need!\\nGALAHAD: You are the keepers of the Holy Grail?\\nZOOT: The what?\\nGALAHAD: The Grail.  It is here.\\nZOOT: Oh, but you are tired, and you must rest awhile.  Midget!  Crapper!\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Yes, O Zoot?\\nZOOT: Prepare a bed for our guest.\\nMIDGET and CRAPPER: Oh thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you!  Thank you! ...\\nZOOT: Away, away varletesses.  The beds here are warm and soft, and very, very big.\\nGALAHAD: Well, look, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: What is your name, handsome knight?\\nGALAHAD: Sir Galahad...  the Chaste.\\nZOOT: Mine is Zoot.  Just Zoot.  Oh, but come.\\nGALAHAD: Look, please!  In God's name, show me the Grail!\\nZOOT: Oh, you have suffered much.  You are delirious.\\nGALAHAD: No, look.  I have seen it!  It is here, in this--\\nZOOT: Sir Galahad!  You would not be so ungallant as to refuse our hospitality.\\nGALAHAD: Well, I-- I-- uh--\\nZOOT: Oh, I am afraid our life must seem very dull and quiet compared to yours.  We are but eight score young blondes and brunettes, all between sixteen and nineteen-and-a-half, cut off in this castle with no one to protect us.  Oooh.  It is a lonely life: bathing, dressing, undressing, making exciting underwear.  We are just not used to handsome knights.  Nay.  Nay.  Come.  Come.  You may lie here.  Oh, but you are wounded!\\nGALAHAD: No, no-- it's-- it's nothing.\\nZOOT: Oh, you must see the doctors immediately!  No, no, please!  Lie down. [clap clap] \\nPIGLET: Well, what seems to be the trouble?\\nGALAHAD: They're doctors?!\\nZOOT: Uh, they have a basic medical training, yes.\\nGALAHAD: B-- but--\\nZOOT: Oh, come, come.  You must try to rest.  Doctor Piglet!  Doctor Winston!  Practice your art.\\nWINSTON: Try to relax.\\nGALAHAD: Are you sure that's absolutely necessary?\\nPIGLET: We must examine you.\\nGALAHAD: There's nothing wrong with that!\\nPIGLET: Please.  We are doctors.\\nGALAHAD: Look!  This cannot be.  I am sworn to chastity.\\nPIGLET: Back to your bed!  At once!\\nGALAHAD: Torment me no longer.  I have seen the Grail!\\nPIGLET: There's no grail here.\\nGALAHAD: I have seen it!  I have seen it! [clank] I have seen--\\nGIRLS: Hello.\\nGALAHAD: Oh.\\nGIRLS: Hello.  Hello.  Hello.  Hello.

I have seen it, here in this castle!\\nDINGO: Oh no.  Oh, no!  Bad, bad Zoot!\\nGALAHAD: Well, what is it?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty Zoot!  She has been setting alight to our beacon, which, I have just remembered, is grail-shaped.  It's not the first time we've had this problem.\\nGALAHAD: It's not the real Grail?\\nDINGO: Oh, wicked, bad, naughty, evil Zoot!  She is a bad person and must pay the penalty.  Do you think this scene should have been cut?  We were so worried when the boys were writing it, but now, we're glad.  It's better than some of the previous scenes, I think.\\nLEFT HEAD: At least ours was better visually.\\nDENNIS: Well, at least ours was committed.  It wasn't just a string of pussy jokes.\\nOLD MAN: Get on with it.\\nTIM THE ENCHANTER: Yes, get on with it!\\nARMY OF KNIGHTS: Yes, get on with it!\\nDINGO: Oh, I am enjoying this scene.\\nGOD: Get on with it!\\nDINGO: [sigh] Oh, wicked, wicked Zoot.  Oh, she is a naughty person, and she must pay the penalty.  And here in Castle Anthrax, we have but one punishment for setting alight the grail-shaped beacon.  You must tie her down on a bed and spank her.\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!\\nDINGO: You must spank her well.  And after you have spanked her, you may deal with her as you like.  And then, spank me.\\nAMAZING: And spank me.\\nSTUNNER: And me.\\nLOVELY: And me.\\nDINGO: Yes, yes, you must give us all a good spanking!\\nGIRLS: A spanking!  A spanking!  There is going to be a spanking tonight!\\nDINGO: And after the spanking, the oral sex.\\nGIRLS: The oral sex!  The oral sex!\\nGALAHAD: Well, I could stay a bit longer.\\nLAUNCELOT: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, hello.\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: What?\\nLAUNCELOT: Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Why?\\nLAUNCELOT: You are in great peril!\\nDINGO: No he isn't.\\nLAUNCELOT: Silence, foul temptress!\\nGALAHAD: You know, she's got a point.\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!  We will cover your escape!\\nGALAHAD: Look, I'm fine!\\nLAUNCELOT: Come on!\\nGIRLS: Sir Galahad!\\nGALAHAD: No.  Look, I can tackle this lot single-handed!\\nDINGO: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nGIRLS: Yes!  Let him tackle us single-handed!\\nLAUNCELOT: No, Sir Galahad.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: No!  Really!  Honestly, I can cope.  I can handle this lot easily.\\nDINGO: Oh, yes.  Let him handle us easily.\\nGIRLS: Yes.  Let him handle us easily.\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  Quick!  Quick!\\nGALAHAD: Please!  I can defeat them!

[boom] \\nDINGO: Oh, shit.\\nLAUNCELOT: We were in the nick of time.  You were in great peril.\\nGALAHAD: I don't think I was.\\nLAUNCELOT: Yes you were.  You were in terrible peril.\\nGALAHAD: Look, let me go back in there and face the peril.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, it's too perilous.\\nGALAHAD: Look, it's my duty as a knight to sample as much peril as I can.\\nLAUNCELOT: No, we've got to find the Holy Grail.  Come on!\\nGALAHAD: Oh, let me have just a little bit of peril?\\nLAUNCELOT: No.  It's unhealthy.\\nGALAHAD: I bet you're gay.\\nLAUNCELOT: No I'm not\\nNARRATOR: Sir Launcelot had saved Sir Galahad from almost certain temptation, but they were still no nearer the Grail.  Meanwhile, King Arthur and Sir Bedevere, not more than a swallow's flight away, had discovered something.  Oh, that's an unladen swallow's flight, obviously.  I mean, they were more than two laden swallows' flights away-- four, really, if they had a coconut on a line between them.  I mean, if the birds were walking and dragging--\\nCROWD: Get on with it!\\nNARRATOR: Oh, anyway.  On to scene twenty-four, which is a smashing scene with some lovely acting, in which Arthur discovers a vital clue, and in which there aren't any swallows, although I think you can hear a starling-- oooh\\nSCENE 12:\\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee ha ha hee hee!

Where is the Grail?!\\nOLD MAN: Seek you the Bridge of Death.\\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death, which leads to the Grail?\\nOLD MAN: Heh, hee hee hee hee!  Ha ha ha ha ha!

Father.\\nHERBERT: B-- b-- but Father, I don't want any of that.\\nFATHER: Listen, lad.  I built this kingdom up from nothing.  When I started here, all there was was swamp.  Other kings said I was daft to build a castle on a swamp, but I built it all the same, just to show 'em.  It sank into the swamp.  So, I built a second one.  That sank into the swamp.  So I built a third one.  That burned down, fell over, then sank into the swamp.  But the fourth one...  stayed up!  And that's what you're gonna get, lad: the strongest castle in these islands.\\nHERBERT: But I don't want any of that.  I'd rather--\\nFATHER: Rather what?!\\nHERBERT: I'd rather...

Where are you going?\\nGUARD #1: We're coming with you.\\nFATHER: No, no.  I want you to stay here and make sure 'e doesn't leave.\\nGUARD #1: Oh, I see.

I've got a rope all ready.\\nFATHER: You killed eight wedding guests in all!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, uh, you see, the thing is, I thought your son was a lady.\\nFATHER: I can understand that.\\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!  Hurry!\\nFATHER: Shut up!  You only killed the bride's father, that's all!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I really didn't mean to...\\nFATHER: Didn't mean to?!  You put your sword right through his head!\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, dear.  Is he all right?\\nFATHER: You even kicked the bride in the chest!  This is going to cost me a fortune!\\nLAUNCELOT: Well, I can explain.  I was in the forest, um, riding north from Camelot, when I got this note, you see--\\nFATHER: Camelot?  Are you from, uh, Camelot?\\nHERBERT: Hurry, Sir Launcelot!\\nLAUNCELOT: Uh, I am a Knight of King Arthur, sir.\\nFATHER: Very nice castle, Camelot.

This is Sir Launcelot from the Court of Camelot, a very brave and influential knight, and my special guest here today.\\nLAUNCELOT: Hello.\\nGUEST: He killed my auntie!\\nGUESTS: [yelling] \\nFATHER: Please!  Please!  This is supposed to be a happy occasion!  Let's not bicker and argue about who killed who.  We are here today to witness the union of two young people in the joyful bond of the holy wedlock.  Unfortunately, one of them, my son Herbert, has just fallen to his death.\\nGUESTS: Oh!  Oh no!\\nFATHER: But I don't want to think I've not lost a son, so much as...  gained a daughter! [clap clap clap] For, since the tragic death of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He's not quite dead!\\nFATHER: Since the near fatal wounding of her father--\\nGUEST #2: He's getting better!\\nFATHER: For, since her own father, who, when he seemed about to recover, suddenly felt the icy hand of death upon him.\\nBRIDE'S FATHER: Uugh!\\nGUEST #2: Oh, he's died!\\nFATHER: And I want his only daughter to look upon me as her old dad, in a very real, and legally binding sense. [clap clap clap] And I feel sure that the merger-- er, the union between the Princess and the brave, but dangerous, Sir Launcelot of Camelot--\\nLAUNCELOT: What?\\nGUEST #2: Look!  The dead Prince!\\nGUESTS: Oooh!  The dead Prince!\\nCONCORDE: He's not quite dead.\\nHERBERT: No, I feel much better.\\nFATHER: You fell out of the Tall Tower, you creep!\\nHERBERT: No, I was saved at the last minute.\\nFATHER: How?!\\nHERBERT: Well, I'll tell you. [music] \\nFATHER: Not like that!  Not like that!  No!  Stop it!\\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!  He's going to tell! ...\\nFATHER: Shut uuup!\\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...\\nFATHER: Shut up!\\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...\\nFATHER: Shut up!\\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell! ...\\nFATHER: Not like that!\\nGUESTS: [singing] He's going to tell!

[sigh] \\nGUESTS: [singing] Oh, he fell a long, long way...\\nCONCORDE: Dramatically, sir?\\nLAUNCELOT: Dramatically!\\nGUESTS: [singing] But he's here with us today...\\nLAUNCELOT: Heee!  Hoa! [crash] Hoo!\\nGUESTS: [singing] What a wonderful escape!\\nLAUNCELOT: Excuse me.  Could, uh-- could somebody give me a push, please\\nSCENE 18: [King Arthur music] [clop clop clop] [rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!  rewr!] \\nARTHUR: Old crone!

We have no shrubberies here.\\nARTHUR: If you do not tell us where we can buy a shrubbery, my friend and I will say...  we will say...  'ni'.\\nCRONE: Agh!  Do your worst!\\nARTHUR: Very well!  If you will not assist us voluntarily, ...  ni!\\nCRONE: No!  Never!

There is a pestilence upon this land.  Nothing is sacred. Even those who arrange and design shrubberies are under considerable economic stress at this period in history.\\nARTHUR: Did you say 'shrubberies'?\\nROGER: Yes.  Shrubberies are my trade.  I am a shrubber.  My name is Roger the Shrubber.  I arrange, design, and sell shrubberies.\\nBEDEVERE: Ni!\\nARTHUR: No!  No, no, no!  No\\nSCENE 19:\\nARTHUR: O Knights of Ni, we have brought you your shrubbery.  May we go now?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: It is a good shrubbery.  I like the laurels particularly.  But there is one small problem.\\nARTHUR: What is that?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: We are now...  no longer the Knights Who Say 'Ni'.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Ni!  Shh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Shh!  We are now the Knights Who Say 'Ecky-ecky-ecky-ecky-pikang-zoop-boing-goodem-zoo-owli-zhiv'.\\nRANDOM: Ni!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Therefore, we must give you a test.\\nARTHUR: What is this test, O Knights of-- Knights Who 'Til Recently Said 'Ni'?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Firstly, you must find...  another shrubbery! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: Not another shrubbery!\\nRANDOM: Ni!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher so you get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: A path!  A path!  A path!  Ni!  Shh!  Ni!  Ni!  Ni!  Shh!  Shh! ...\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest...  with...  a herring! [dramatic chord] \\nARTHUR: We shall do no such thing!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Oh, please!\\nARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring?  It can't be done.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaugh!  Aaaugh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Augh!  Ohh!  Don't say that word.\\nARTHUR: What word?\\nHEAD KNIGHT: I cannot tell, suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni cannot hear.\\nARTHUR: How can we not say the word if you don't tell us what it is?\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: You said it again!\\nARTHUR: What, 'is'?\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Agh!  No, not 'is'.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: No, not 'is'.  You wouldn't get vary far in life not saying 'is'.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: No, not 'is'.  Not 'is'.\\nBEDEVERE: My liege, it's Sir Robin!\\nMINSTREL: [singing] Packing it in and packing it up, And sneaking away and buggering up, And chickening out and pissing off home, Yes, bravely he is throwing in the sponge.\\nARTHUR: Sir Robin!\\nROBIN: My liege!  It's good to see you.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Now he's said the word!  \\nARTHUR: Surely you've not given up your quest for the Holy Grail?\\nMINSTREL: [singing] He is sneaking away and buggering up--\\nROBIN: Shut up!  No, no.  No.  Far from it.\\nHEAD KNIGHT: He said the word again!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nROBIN: I was looking for it.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nROBIN: Uh, here-- here in this forest.\\nARTHUR: No, it is far from this place.\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Aaaaugh!  Stop saying the word!  The word...\\nARTHUR: Oh, stop it!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: ... we cannot hear!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Ow!  He said it again!\\nARTHUR: Patsy!\\nHEAD KNIGHT: Wait!  I said it!  I said it! [clop clop clop] Ooh!  I said it again!  And there again!  That's three 'it's!  Ohh!\\nKNIGHTS OF NI: Aaaaugh\\nNARRATOR: And so, Arthur and Bedevere and Sir Robin set out on their search to find the enchanter of whom the old man had spoken in scene twenty-four.  Beyond the forest they met Launcelot and Galahad, and there was much rejoicing.\\nKNIGHTS: Yay!  Yay! [woosh] \\nNARRATOR: In the frozen land of Nador, they were forced to eat Robin's minstrels.\\nMINSTREL: [high-pitched] Get back!  Eee!\\nNARRATOR: And there was much rejoicing.\\nKNIGHTS: Yay!\\nNARRATOR: A year passed.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: [shivering] \\nNARRATOR: Winter changed into Spring.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Mmm, nice.\\nNARRATOR: Spring changed into Summer.\\nCARTOON CHARACTER: Oh.

[boom pweeng boom boom] \\nARTHUR: Look, um, you're a busy man, uh--\\nTIM: Yes, I can help you find the Holy Grail.\\nKNIGHTS: Oh, thank you.  Oh...\\nTIM: To the north there lies a cave-- the cave of Caerbannog-- wherein, carved in mystic runes upon the very living rock, the last words of Olfin Bedwere of Rheged... [boom] ... make plain the last resting place of the most Holy Grail.\\nARTHUR: Where could we find this cave, O Tim?\\nTIM: Follow.  But!  Follow only if ye be men of valor, for the entrance to this cave is guarded by a creature so foul, so cruel that no man yet has fought with it and lived!  Bones of full fifty men lie strewn about its lair.  So, brave knights, if you do doubt your courage or your strength, come no further, for death awaits you all with nasty, big, pointy teeth.\\nARTHUR: What an eccentric performance\\nSCENE 21: [clop clop clop] [whinny whinny] \\nGALAHAD: They're nervous, sire.\\nARTHUR: Then we'd best leave them here and carry on on foot.  Dis-mount!\\nTIM: Behold the cave of Caerbannog!\\nARTHUR: Right!  Keep me covered.\\nGALAHAD: What with?\\nARTHUR: W-- just keep me covered.\\nTIM: Too late!

That rabbit's dynamite.\\nROBIN: Would it help to confuse it if we run away more?\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up and go and change your armor.\\nGALAHAD: Let us taunt it!  It may become so cross that it will make a mistake.\\nARTHUR: Like what?\\nGALAHAD: Well...  ooh.\\nLAUNCELOT: Have we got bows?\\nARTHUR: No.\\nLAUNCELOT: We have the Holy Hand Grenade.\\nARTHUR: Yes, of course!  The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch!  'Tis one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries with him!  Brother Maynard!

And the Lord did grin, and the people did feast upon the lambs and sloths and carp and anchovies and orangutans and breakfast cereals and fruit bats and large chu--\\nMAYNARD: Skip a bit, Brother.\\nSECOND BROTHER: And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.  Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less.  Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three.  Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three.  Five is right out.  Once the number three, being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in my sight, shall snuff it.'\\nMAYNARD: Amen.\\nKNIGHTS: Amen.\\nARTHUR: Right!  One...  two...  five!\\nGALAHAD: Three, sir!\\nARTHUR: Three! [angels sing] [boom] \\nSCENE 22:\\nARTHUR: There!

Joseph of Arimathea!\\nLAUNCELOT: 'Course!\\nARTHUR: What does it say?\\nMAYNARD: It reads, 'Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the Castle of uuggggggh'.\\nARTHUR: What?\\nMAYNARD: '...  the Castle of uuggggggh'.\\nBEDEVERE: What is that?\\nMAYNARD: He must have died while carving it.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, come on!\\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what it says.\\nARTHUR: Look, if he was dying, he wouldn't bother to carve 'aaggggh'.  He'd just say it!\\nMAYNARD: Well, that's what's carved in the rock!\\nGALAHAD: Perhaps he was dictating.\\nARTHUR: Oh, shut up.  Well, does it say anything else?\\nMAYNARD: No.  Just, 'uuggggggh'.\\nLAUNCELOT: Aauuggghhh.\\nARTHUR: Aaauggh.\\nBEDEVERE: Do you suppose he meant the Camaaaaaargue?\\nGALAHAD: Where's that?\\nBEDEVERE: France, I think.\\nLAUNCELOT: Isn't there a Saint Aauuuves in Cornwall?\\nARTHUR: No, that's Saint Ives.\\nLAUNCELOT: Oh, yes.

The quest for Holy Grail could continue.\\nSCENE 23: [gurgle] \\nGALAHAD: There it is!\\nARTHUR: The Bridge of Death!\\nROBIN: Oh, great.\\nARTHUR: Look!

    "2. Bag-of-words\n",
    "Bag of words is a very simple and basic method to finding topics in a text. For bag of words, you need to first create tokens using tokenization, and then count up all the tokens you have. The theory is that the more frequent a word or token is, the more central or important it might be to the text. Bag of words can be a great way to determine the significant words in a text based on the number of times they are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bag-of-words example\n",
    "Here we see an example series of sentences, mainly about a cat and a box. If we just us a simple bag of words model with tokenization like we learned in chapter one and remove the punctuation, we can see the example result. Box, cat, The and the are some of the most important words because they are the most frequent. Notice that the word THE appears twice in the bag of words, once with uppercase and once lowercase. If we added a preprocessing step to handle this issue, we could lowercase all of the words in the text so each word is counted only once.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bag-of-words in Python\n",
    "We can use the NLP fundamentals we already know, such as tokenization with NLTK to create a list of tokens. We will use a new class called Counter which we import from the standard library module collections. The list of tokens generated using word_tokenize can be passed as the initialization argument for the Counter class. The result is a counter object which has similar structure to a dictionary and allows us to see each token and the frequency of the token. Counter objects also have a method called `most_common`, which takes an integer argument, such as 2 and would then return the top 2 tokens in terms of frequency. The return object is a series of tuples inside a list. For each tuple, the first element holds the token and the second element represents the frequency. Note: other than ordering by token frequency, the most_common method does not sort the tokens it returns or tell us there are more tokens with that same frequency.\n",

However the term \"bug\" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison (see software bug for a full discussion), and \"debugging\" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers. Indeed, in an interview Grace Hopper remarked that she was not coining the term{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The moth fit the already existing terminology, so it was saved.  A letter from J. Robert Oppenheimer (director of the WWII atomic bomb \"Manhattan\" project at Los Alamos, NM) used the term in a letter to Dr. Ernest Lawrence at UC Berkeley, dated October 27, 1944,http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/images/bigscience25.jpg regarding the recruitment of additional technical staff.\\n\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary entry for \"debug\" quotes the term \"debugging\" used in reference to airplane engine testing in a 1945 article in the Journal of the Royal Aeronautical Society. An article in \"Airforce\" (June 1945 p.&nbsp;50) also refers to debugging, this time of aircraft cameras.  Hopper\\'s computer bug|bug was found on September 9, 1947. The term was not adopted by computer programmers until the early 1950s.\\nThe seminal article by GillS. Gill, [http://www.jstor.org/stable/98663 The Diagnosis of Mistakes in Programmes on the EDSAC], Proceedings of the Royal Society of London. Series A, Mathematical and Physical Sciences, Vol. 206, No. 1087 (May 22, 1951), pp. 538-554 in 1951 is the earliest in-depth discussion of programming errors, but it does not use the term \"bug\" or \"debugging\".\\nIn the Association for Computing Machinery|ACM\\'s digital library, the term \"debugging\" is first used in three papers from 1952 ACM National Meetings.Robert V. D. Campbell, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=609784.609786 Evolution of automatic computation], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p 29-32, 1952.Alex Orden, [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=609784.609793 Solution of systems of linear inequalities on a digital computer], Proceedings of the 1952 ACM national meeting (Pittsburgh), p. 91-95, 1952.Howard B.

Press, 1963\\n\\nKidwell\\'s article \\'\\'Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug\\'\\'Peggy Aldrich Kidwell, [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?tp=&arnumber=728224&isnumber=15706 Stalking the Elusive Computer Bug], IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, 1998. discusses the etymology of \"bug\" and \"debug\" in greater detail.\\n\\nScope\\nAs software and electronic systems have become generally more complex, the various common debugging techniques have expanded with more methods to detect anomalies, assess impact, and schedule software patches or full updates to a system. The words \"anomaly\" and \"discrepancy\" can be used, as being more neutral terms, to avoid the words \"error\" and \"defect\" or \"bug\" where there might be an implication that all so-called \\'\\'errors\\'\\', \\'\\'defects\\'\\' or \\'\\'bugs\\'\\' must be fixed (at all costs). Instead, an impact assessment can be made to determine if changes to remove an \\'\\'anomaly\\'\\' (or \\'\\'discrepancy\\'\\') would be cost-effective for the system, or perhaps a scheduled new release might render the change(s) unnecessary. Not all issues are life-critical or mission-critical in a system. Also, it is important to avoid the situation where a change might be more upsetting to users, long-term, than living with the known problem(s) (where the \"cure would be worse than the disease\"). Basing decisions of the acceptability of some anomalies can avoid a culture of a \"zero-defects\" mandate, where people might be tempted to deny the existence of problems so that the result would appear as zero \\'\\'defects\\'\\'. Considering the collateral issues, such as the cost-versus-benefit impact assessment, then broader debugging techniques will expand to determine the frequency of anomalies (how often the same \"bugs\" occur) to help assess their impact to the overall system.\\n\\nTools\\nDebugging on video game consoles is usually done with special hardware such as this Xbox (console)|Xbox debug unit intended for developers.\\n\\nDebugging ranges in complexity from fixing simple errors to performing lengthy and tiresome tasks of data collection, analysis, and scheduling updates.  The debugging skill of the programmer can be a major factor in the ability to debug a problem, but the difficulty of software debugging varies greatly with the complexity of the system, and also depends, to some extent, on the programming language(s) used and the available tools, such as \\'\\'debuggers\\'\\'. Debuggers are software tools which enable the programmer to monitor the execution (computers)|execution of a program, stop it, restart it, set breakpoints, and change values in memory. The term \\'\\'debugger\\'\\' can also refer to the person who is doing the debugging.\\n\\nGenerally, high-level programming languages, such as Java (programming language)|Java, make debugging easier, because they have features such as exception handling that make real sources of erratic behaviour easier to spot. In programming languages such as C (programming language)|C or assembly language|assembly, bugs may cause silent problems such as memory corruption, and it is often difficult to see where the initial problem happened. In those cases, memory debugging|memory debugger tools may be needed.\\n\\nIn certain situations, general purpose software tools that are language specific in nature can be very useful.  These take the form of \\'\\'List of tools for static code analysis|static code analysis tools\\'\\'.  These tools look for a very specific set of known problems, some common and some rare, within the source code.  All such issues detected by these tools would rarely be picked up by a compiler or interpreter, thus they are not syntax checkers, but more semantic checkers.  Some tools claim to be able to detect 300+ unique problems. Both commercial and free tools exist in various languages.  These tools can be extremely useful when checking very large source trees, where it is impractical to do code walkthroughs.  A typical example of a problem detected would be a variable dereference that occurs \\'\\'before\\'\\' the variable is assigned a value.  Another example would be to perform strong type checking when the language does not require such.  Thus, they are better at locating likely errors, versus actual errors.  As a result, these tools have a reputation of false positives.  The old Unix \\'\\'Lint programming tool|lint\\'\\' program is an early example.\\n\\nFor debugging electronic hardware (e.g., computer hardware) as well as low-level software (e.g., BIOSes, device drivers) and firmware, instruments such as oscilloscopes, logic analyzers or in-circuit emulator|in-circuit emulators (ICEs) are often used, alone or in combination.  An ICE may perform many of the typical software debugger\\'s tasks on low-level software and firmware.\\n\\nDebugging process \\nNormally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This can be a non-trivial task, for example as with Parallel computing|parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.\\n\\nAfter the bug is reproduced, the input of the program may need to be simplified to make it easier to debug. For example, a bug in a compiler can make it Crash (computing)|crash when parsing some large source file. However, after simplification of the test case, only few lines from the original source file can be sufficient to reproduce the same crash. Such simplification can be made manually, using a Divide and conquer algorithm|divide-and-conquer approach. The programmer will try to remove some parts of original test case and check if the problem still exists. When debugging the problem in a Graphical user interface|GUI, the programmer can try to skip some user interaction from the original problem description and check if remaining actions are sufficient for bugs to appear.\\n\\nAfter the test case is sufficiently simplified, a programmer can use a debugger tool to examine program states (values of variables, plus the call stack) and track down the origin of the problem(s). Alternatively, Tracing (software)|tracing can be used. In simple cases, tracing is just a few print statements, which output the values of variables at certain points of program execution.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\\n\\n Techniques \\n \\'\\'Interactive debugging\\'\\'\\n \\'\\'{{visible anchor|Print debugging}}\\'\\' (or tracing) is the act of watching (live or recorded) trace statements, or print statements, that indicate the flow of execution of a process. This is sometimes called \\'\\'{{visible anchor|printf debugging}}\\'\\', due to the use of the printf function in C. This kind of debugging was turned on by the command TRON in the original versions of the novice-oriented BASIC programming language. TRON stood for, \"Trace On.\" TRON caused the line numbers of each BASIC command line to print as the program ran.\\n \\'\\'Remote debugging\\'\\' is the process of debugging a program running on a system different from the debugger. To start remote debugging, a debugger connects to a remote system over a network. The debugger can then control the execution of the program on the remote system and retrieve information about its state.\\n \\'\\'Post-mortem debugging\\'\\' is debugging of the program after it has already Crash (computing)|crashed. Related techniques often include various tracing techniques (for example,[http://www.drdobbs.com/tools/185300443 Postmortem Debugging, Stephen Wormuller, Dr. Dobbs Journal, 2006]) and/or analysis of memory dump (or core dump) of the crashed process. The dump of the process could be obtained automatically by the system (for example, when process has terminated due to an unhandled exception), or by a programmer-inserted instruction, or manually by the interactive user.\\n \\'\\'\"Wolf fence\" algorithm:\\'\\' Edward Gauss described this simple but very useful and now famous algorithm in a 1982 article for communications of the ACM as follows: \"There\\'s one wolf in Alaska; how do you find it? First build a fence down the middle of the state, wait for the wolf to howl, determine which side of the fence it is on. Repeat process on that side only, until you get to the point where you can see the wolf.\"<ref name=\"communications of the ACM\">{{cite journal | title=\"Pracniques: The \"Wolf Fence\" Algorithm for Debugging\", | author=E.

Embedded systems are, by definition, not general-purpose designs: they are typically developed for a single task (or small range of tasks), and the platform is chosen specifically to optimize that application.

    "Text processing helps make for better input data when performing machine learning or other statistical methods. For example, in the last few exercises you have applied small bits of preprocessing (like tokenization) to create a bag of words. You also noticed that applying simple techniques like lowercasing all of the tokens, can lead to slightly better results for a bag-of-words model. Preprocessing steps like tokenization or lowercasing words are commonly used in NLP. Other common techniques are things like lemmatization or stemming, where you shorten the words to their root stems, or techniques like removing stop words, which are common words in a language that don't carry a lot of meaning -- such as and or the, or removing punctuation or unwanted tokens. Of course, each model and process will have different results -- so it's good to try a few different approaches to preprocessing and see which works best for your task and goal.\n",

    "3. Preprocessing example\n",
    "We have here some example input and output text we might expect from preprocessing. First we have a simple two sentence string about pets. Then we have some example output tokens we want. You can see that the text has been tokenized and that everything is lowercase. We also notice that stopwords have been removed and the plural nouns have been made singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Text preprocessing with Python\n",
    "We can perform text preprocessing using many of the tools we already know and have learned. In this code, we are using the same text as from our previous video, a few sentences about a cat with a box. We can use list comprehensions to tokenize the sentences which we first make lowercase using the string lower method. The string is_alpha method will return True if the string has only alphabetical characters. We use the is_alpha method along with an if statement iterating over our tokenized result to only return only alphabetic strings (this will effectively strip tokens with numbers or punctuation). To read out the process in both code and English we say we take each token from the word_tokenize output of the lowercase text if it contains only alphabetical characters. In the next line, we use another list comprehension to remove words that are in the stopwords list. This stopwords list for english comes built in with the NLTK library. Finally, we can create a counter and check the two most common words, which are now cat and box (unlike the and box which were the two tokens returned in our first result). Preprocessing has already improved our bag of words and made it more useful by removing the stopwords and non-alphabetic words.\n",

    "5. Let's practice!\n",
    "You can now get started by preprocessing your own text!"

    "# Text preprocessing practice\n",
    "Now, it's your turn to apply the techniques you've learned to help clean up text for better NLP results. You'll need to remove stop words and non-alphabetic characters, lemmatize, and perform a new bag-of-words on your cleaned text.\n",
    "\n",
    "You start with the same tokens you created in the last exercise: lower_tokens. You also have the Counter class imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "0 XP\n",
    "Import the WordNetLemmatizer class from nltk.stem.\n",
    "Create a list alpha_only that contains only alphabetical characters. You can use the .isalpha() method to check for this.\n",
    "Create another list called no_stops consisting of words from alpha_only that are not contained in english_stops.\n",
    "Initialize a WordNetLemmatizer object called wordnet_lemmatizer and use its .lemmatize() method on the tokens in no_stops to create a new list called lemmatized.\n",
    "Create a new Counter called bow with the lemmatized words.\n",
    "Lastly, print the 10 most common tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint\n",
    "You can use the command from y import x to import x from y.\n",
    "In the conditional of your list comprehension, use t.isalpha() to check whether or not the character is alphabetical.\n",
    "To remove stop words, iterate over alpha_only and retain the words if they are not in english_stops.\n",
    "Use WordNetLemmatizer() to create wordnet_lemmatizer. Then, in the list comprehension, use its .lemmatize() method with t as the argument as you iterate over no_stops.\n",
    "To create bow, you can use Counter() with lemmatized as its argument. Then, you can use the .most_common() method to find the 10 most common tokens in bow."

    "# 1. Introduction to gensim\n",
    "In this video, we will get started using a new tool called Gensim.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is gensim?\n",
    "**Gensim** is a popular open-source natural language processing library. It uses top academic models to perform complex tasks like building document or word vectors, corpora and performing topic identification and document comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is a word vector?\n",
    "You might be wondering what a word or document vector is? Here are some examples here in visual form. A word embedding or vector is trained from a larger corpus and is a multi-dimensional representation of a word or document. You can think of it as a multi-dimensional array normally with sparse features (lots of zeros and some ones). With these vectors, we can then see relationships among the words or documents based on how near or far they are and also what similar comparisons we find. For example, in this graphic we can see that the vector operation king minus queen is approximately equal to man minus woman. Or that Spain is to Madrid as Italy is to Rome. The deep learning algorithm used to create word vectors has been able to distill this meaning based on how those words are used throughout the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Gensim example\n",
    "The graphic we have here is an example of LDA visualization. LDA stands for latent dirichlet allocation, and it is a statistical model we can apply to text using Gensim for topic analysis and modelling. This graph is just a portion of a blog post written in 2015 using Gensim to analyze US presidential addresses. The article is really neat and you can find the link here.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Creating a gensim dictionary\n",
    "Gensim allows you to build corpora and dictionaries using simple classes and functions. A corpus (or if plural, corpora) is a set of texts used to help perform natural language processing tasks. Here, our documents are a list of strings that look like movie reviews about space or sci-fi films. First we need to do some basic preprocessing. For brevity, we will only tokenize and lowercase. For better results, we would want to apply more of the preprocessing we have learned in this chapter, such as removing punctuation and stop words. Then we can pass the tokenized documents to the Gensim Dictionary class. This will create a mapping with an id for each token. This is the beginning of our corpus. We now can represent whole documents using just a list of their token ids and how often those tokens appear in each document. We can take a look at the tokens and their ids by looking at the token2id attribute, which is a dictionary of all of our tokens and their respective ids in our new dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Creating a gensim corpus\n",
    "Using the dictionary we built in the last slide, we can then create a Gensim corpus. This is a bit different than a normal corpus -- which is just a collection of documents. Gensim uses a simple bag-of-words model which transforms each document into a bag of words using the token ids and the frequency of each token in the document. Here, we can see that the Gensim corpus is a list of lists, each list item representing one document. Each document a series of tuples, the first item representing the tokenid from the dictionary and the second item representing the token frequency in the document. In only a few lines, we have a new bag-of-words model and corpus thanks to Gensim. And unlike our previous Counter-based bag of words, this Gensim model can be easily saved, updated and reused thanks to the extra tools we have available in Gensim. Our dictionary can also be updated with new texts and extract only words that meet particular thresholds. We are building a more advanced and feature-rich bag-of-words model which can then be used for future exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Let's practice!\n",
    "Now you can get started building your own dictionary with Gensim!"

    "# Creating and querying a corpus with gensim\n",
    "It's time to apply the methods you learned in the previous video to create your first gensim dictionary and corpus!\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll use these data structures to investigate word trends and potential interesting topics in your document set. To get started, we have imported a few additional messy articles from Wikipedia, which were preprocessed by lowercasing all words, tokenizing them, and removing stop words and punctuation. These were then stored in a list of document tokens called articles. You'll need to do some light preprocessing and then generate the gensim dictionary and corpus.\n",

    "Initialize a gensim Dictionary with the tokens in articles.\n",
    "Obtain the id for \"computer\" from dictionary. To do this, use its .token2id method which returns ids from text, and then chain .get() which returns tokens from ids. Pass in \"computer\" as an argument to .get().\n",
    "Use a list comprehension in which you iterate over articles to create a gensim MmCorpus from dictionary.\n",
    "In the output expression, use the .doc2bow() method on dictionary with article as the argument.\n",

    "In this video, we will learn how to use a TFIDF model with Gensim.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is tf-idf?\n",
    "**Tf-idf** stands for term-frequncy - inverse document frequency. It is a commonly used natural language processing model that helps you determine the most important words in each document in the corpus. The idea behind tf-idf is that each corpus might have more shared words than just stopwords. These common words are like stopwords and should be removed or at least down-weighted in importance. For example, if I am an astronomer, sky might be used often but is not important, so I want to downweight that word. TF-Idf does precisely that. It will take texts that share common language and ensure the most common words across the entire corpus don't show up as keywords. Tf-idf helps keep the document-specific frequent words weighted high and the common words across the entire corpus weighted low.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Tf-idf formula\n",
    "The equation to calculate the weights can be outlined like so: The weight of token i in document j is calculated by taking the term frequency (or how many times the token appears in the document) multiplied by the log of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents that contain the same term. Let's unpack this a bit. First, the weight will be low if the term doesnt appear often in the document because the tf variable will then be low. However, the weight will also be a low if the logarithm is close to zero, meaning the internal equation is low. Here we can see if the total number of documents divded by the number of documents that have the term is close to one, then our logarithm will be close to zero. So words that occur across many or all documents will have a very low tf-idf weight. On the contrary, if the word only occurs in a few documents, that logarithm will return a higher number.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Tf-idf with gensim\n",
    "You can build a Tfidf model using Gensim and the corpus you developed previously. Taking a look at the corpus we used in the last video, around movie reviews, we can use the Bag of Words corpus to translate it into a TF-idf model by simply passing it in initialization. We can then reference each document by using it like a dictionary key with our new tfidf model. For the second document in our corpora, we see the token weights along with the token ids. Notice there are some large differences! Token id 10 has a weight of 0.77 whereas tokens 0 and 1 have weights below 0.18. These weights can help you determine good topics and keywords for a corpus with shared vocabulary.\n",

    "Welcome to our first video on named entity recognition!\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is Named Entity Recognition?\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition or NER for short is a natural language processing task used to identify important named entities in the text -- such as people, places and organizations -- they can even be dates, states, works of art and other categories depending on the libraries and notation you use. NER can be used alongside topic identification, or on its own to determine important items in a text or answer basic natural language understanding questions such as who? what? when and where?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Example of NER\n",
    "For example, take this piece of text which is from the English Wikipedia article on Albert Einstein. The text has been highlighted for different types of named entities that were found using the Stanford NER library. You can see the dates, locations, persons and organizations found and extract infomation on the text based on these named entities. You can use NER to solve problems like fact extraction as well as which entities are related using computational language models. For example, in this text we can see that Einstein has something to do with the United States, Adolf Hitler and Germany. We can also see by token proximity that Betrand Russel and Einstein created the Russel-Einstein manifesto -- all from simple entity highlighting.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. nltk and the Stanford CoreNLP Library\n",
    "NLTK allows you to interact with named entity recognition via it's own model, but also the aforementioned Stanford library. The Stanford library integration requires you to perform a few steps before you can use it, including installing the required Java files and setting system environment variables. You can also use the standford library on its own without integrating it with NLTK or operate it as an API server. The stanford CoreNLP library has great support for named entity recognition as well as some related nlp tasks such as coreference (or linking pronouns and entities together) and dependency trees to help with parsing meaning and relationships amongst words or phrases in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Using nltk for Named Entity Recognition\n",
    "For our simple use case, we will use the built-in named entity recognition with NLTK. To do so, we take a normal sentence, and preprocess it via tokenization. Then, we can tag the sentence for parts of speech. This will add tags for proper nouns, pronouns, adjective, verbs and other part of speech that NLTK uses based on an english grammar. When we take a look at the tags, we see New and York are tagged NNP which is the tag for a proper noun, singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. nltk's ne_chunk()\n",
    "Then we pass this tagged sentence into the ne_chunk function, or named entity chunk, which will return the sentence as a tree. NLTK Tree's might look a bit different than trees you might use in other libraries, but they do have leaves and subtrees representing more complex grammar. This tree shows the named entities tagged as their own chunks such as GPE or geopolitical entity for New York, or MOMA and Metro as organizations. It also identifies Ruth Reichl as a person. It does so without consulting a knowledge base, like wikipedia, but instead uses trained statistical and grammatical parsers.\n",

    "1. Introduction to SpaCy\n",
    "In this video, we'll take a look at SpaCy, another great library for natural language processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is SpaCy?\n",
    "SpaCy is a NLP library similar to Gensim, but with different implementations, including a particular focus on creating NLP pipelines to generate models and corpora. SpaCy is open-source and has several extra libraries and tools built by the same team, including Displacy - a visualization tool for viewing parse trees which uses Node-js to create interactive text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Displacy entity recognition visualizer\n",
    "For example, if we use the displacy entity recognition visualizer which has a live demo online, we can enter the sentence used in the last video. Here, we can see the SpaCy has identified three named entities and tagged them with the appropriate entity label -- such as location or person. SpaCy also has tools to build word and document vectors from text.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. SpaCy NER\n",
    "To start using spacy for Named entity recognition, we must first install it and download all the appropriate pre-trained word vectors. You can also train vectors yourself and load them; but the pretrained ones let us get started immediately. We can load those into an object, NLP, which functions similarly to our Gensim dictionary and corpus. It has several linked objects, including entity which is an Entity Recognizer object from the pipeline module. This is what is used to find entities in the text. Then we load a new document by passing a string into the NLP variable. When the document is loaded, the named entities are stored as a document attribute called ents. We see Spacy properly tagged and identified the three main entities in the sentence. We can also investigate the labels of each entity by using indexing to pick out the first entity and the label_ attribute to see the label for that particular entity. Here we see the label for Berlin is GPE or Geopolitical entity. Spacy has several other language models available, including advanced German and Chinese implementations. It's a great tool especially if you want to build your own extraction and natural language processing pipeline quickly and iteratively.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Why use SpaCy for NER?\n",
    "Why use Spacy for NER? Outside of being able to integrate with the other great Spacy features like easy pipeline creation, it has a different set of entity types and often labels entities differently than nltk. In addition, Spacy comes with informal language corpora, allowing you to more easily find entities in documents like Tweets and chat messages. It's a quickly growing library, so it might even have more languages supported by the time you are watching this video!\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Let's practice!\n",
    "For now, however, you can get started using Spacy for named entity recognition!"

    "\n",
    "The article has been pre-loaded as article. To minimize execution times, you'll be asked to specify the keyword arguments tagger=False, parser=False, matcher=False when loading the spaCy model, because you only care about the entity in this exercise.\n",
