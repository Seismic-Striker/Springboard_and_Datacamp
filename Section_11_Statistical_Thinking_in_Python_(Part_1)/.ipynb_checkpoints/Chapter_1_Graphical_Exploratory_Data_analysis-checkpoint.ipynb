    "# 1. Introduction to Exploratory Data Analysis\n",
    "Yogi Berra said, \"You can observe a lot by watching.\" The same is true with data. If you can appropriately display your data, you can already start to draw conclusions from it. I'll go even further. Exploring your data is a crucial step in your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Exploratory data analysis\n",
    "When I say exploring your data, I mean organizing and plotting your data, and maybe computing a few numerical summaries about them. This idea is known as exploratory data analysis, or EDA, and was developed by one of the greatest statisticians of all time, John Tukey. He wrote a book entitled Exploratory Data Analysis in 1977 where he laid out the principles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. John Tukey\n",
    "In that book, he said, \"Exploratory data analysis can never be the whole story, but nothing else can serve as the foundation stone.\" I wholeheartedly agree with this, so we will begin our study of statistical thinking with EDA. Let's consider an example.\n",

    "4. 2008 US swing state election results\n",
    "Here, we have a data set I acquired from data dot gov containing the election results of 2008 at the county level in each of the three major swing states of Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Florida. Those are the ones that largely decide recent elections in the US. This is how they look when I open the file with my text editor. They are a little prettier if we look at them with in a Pandas DataFrame,\n",

    "in this case only looking at the columns of immediate interest, the state, county, and share of the vote that went to Democrat Barack Obama. We could stare the these numbers, but I think you'll agree that it is pretty hopeless to gain any sort of understanding from doing this. Alternatively, we could charge in headlong and start defining and computing parameters and their confidence intervals, and do hypothesis tests. You will learn how to do all of these things in this course and its sequel. But a good field commander does not just charge into battle without first getting a feel for the terrain and sizing up the opposing army. So, like the field commander, we should explore the data first. In this chapter, we will discuss graphical exploratory data analysis. This involves taking data from tabular form, like we have here in the DataFrame,\n",

    "and representing it graphically. You are presenting the same information, but it is in a more human-interpretable form. For example, we take the Democratic share of the vote in the counties of all of the three swing states and plot them as a histogram. The height of each bar is the number of counties that had the given level of support for Obama. For example, the tallest bar is the number of counties that had between 40% and 50% of its votes cast for Obama. Right away, because there is more area in the histogram to the left of 50%, we can see that more counties voted for Obama's opponent, John McCain, than voted for Obama. Look at that. Just by making one plot, we could already draw a conclusion about the data, which would have been extraordinarily tedious by hand counting in the DataFrame.\n",

    "# 1. Plotting a histogram\n",
    "We saw in the last video that a histogram can be a useful plot to generate when exploring a data set. Let's go over how we can create one.\n",

    "3. Generating a histogram\n",
    "the matplotlib dot pyplot module's hist function. We pass it the dem_share column of the DataFrame. We could have also passed a NumPy array with the same data, and it works just fine. In fact, for this course and its sequel, you can use DataFrames and NumPy arrays interchangeably. Note that plt dot hist returns three arrays that I am not interested in; I only want the plot. I therefore assign a dummy variable called \"underscore\" to them, which is common practice in Python. After creating the histogram, we label the axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Always label your axes\n",
    "Always label your axes, for histograms or any other kind of plot. Otherwise no one can know what it is you are plotting.\n",

    "\n",
    "6. Histograms with different binning\n",
    "They are different because they have different binning. In the plot at left, we have ten bins that were automatically generated by the default settings of plt dot hist, and I set up the bins on the right myself.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Setting the bins of a histogram\n",
    "I specified where the edges of the bars of the histogram are, the bin edges, and use the bins keyword argument to pass that to plt dot hist.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Setting the bins of a histogram\n",
    "You can also specify a number of bins, say 20, using the bins keyword argument, and Matplotlib will automatically generate 20 evenly spaced bins. Now, the plots we've made so far are stylized with Matplotlib's default settings. I prefer to use the default settings\n",

The dataset is taken\\nfrom Fisher\\'s paper. Note that it\\'s the same as in R, but not as in the UCI\\nMachine Learning Repository, which has two wrong data points.\\n\\nThis is perhaps the best known database to be found in the\\npattern recognition literature.  Fisher\\'s paper is a classic in the field and\\nis referenced frequently to this day.  (See Duda & Hart, for example.)  The\\ndata set contains 3 classes of 50 instances each, where each class refers to a\\ntype of iris plant.  One class is linearly separable from the other 2; the\\nlatter are NOT linearly separable from each other.\\n\\n.. topic:: References\\n\\n   - Fisher, R.A. \"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\"\\n     Annual Eugenics, 7, Part II, 179-188 (1936); also in \"Contributions to\\n     Mathematical Statistics\" (John Wiley, NY, 1950).\\n   - Duda, R.O., & Hart, P.E.

    "# Plotting a histogram of iris data\n",
    "For the exercises in this section, you will use a classic data set collected by botanist Edward Anderson and made famous by Ronald Fisher, one of the most prolific statisticians in history. Anderson carefully measured the anatomical properties of samples of three different species of iris, Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. The full data set is available as part of scikit-learn. Here, you will work with his measurements of petal length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plot a histogram of the petal lengths of his 50 samples of Iris versicolor using matplotlib/seaborn's default settings. Recall that to specify the default seaborn style, you can use sns.set(), where sns is the alias that seaborn is imported as.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subset of the data set containing the Iris versicolor petal lengths in units of centimeters (cm) is stored in the NumPy array versicolor_petal_length.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the video, Justin plotted the histograms by using the pandas library and indexing the DataFrame to extract the desired column. Here, however, you only need to use the provided NumPy array. Also, Justin assigned his plotting statements (except for plt.show()) to the dummy variable _. This is to prevent unnecessary output from being displayed. It is not required for your solutions to these exercises, however it is good practice to use it. Alternatively, if you are working in an interactive environment such as a Jupyter notebook, you could use a ; after your plotting statements to achieve the same effect. Justin prefers using _. Therefore, you will see it used in the solution code.\n",

The \"square root rule\" is a commonly-used rule of thumb for choosing number of bins: choose the number of bins to be the square root of the number of samples.

We make the swarm plot as before, but using a DataFrame that contains all states, with each classified as being east or west of the Mississippi. The bee swarm plot has a real problem. The edges have overlapping data points, which was necessary in order to fit all points onto the plot. We are now obfuscating data. So, using a bee swarm plot here is not the best option.

    "we can compute an empirical cumulative distribution function, or ECDF. Again, this is best explained by example. Here is a picture of an ECDF of the percentage of swing state votes that went to Obama. A x-value of an ECDF is the quantity you are measuring, in this case the percent of vote that sent to Obama. The y-value is the fraction of data points that have a value smaller than the corresponding x-value.\n",

    "7. Making an ECDF\n",
    "Let's look at how to make one of these from our data. The x-axis is the sorted data. We need to generate it using the NumPy function sort, so we need to import Numpy, which we do using the alias np as is commonly done. The we can use np dot sort to generate our x-data. The y-axis is evenly spaced data points with a maximum of one, which we can generate using the np dot arange function and then dividing by the total number of data points. Once we specify the x and y values, we plot the points. By default, plt-dot-plot plots lines connecting the data points. To plot our ECDF, we just want points. To achieve this we pass the string period and the string 'none' to the keywords arguments marker and linestyle, respectively. As you remember from my forceful reminder in an earlier video, we label the axes. Finally, we use the plt dot margins function to make sure none of the data points run over the side of the plot area. Choosing a value of point-02 gives a 2% buffer all around the plot.\n",

    "For example, here are the ECDFs for the three swing states. We see that Ohio and Pennsylvania were similar, with Pennsylvania having slightly more Democratic counties. Florida, on the other hand, had a greater fraction of heavily Republican counties. In my workflow, I almost always plot the ECDF first. It shows all the data and gives a complete picture of how the data are distributed.\n",

    "4. Coming up…\n",
    "In the next chapter, you will build upon graphical EDA with quantitative EDA, which allows you to compute useful summary statistics. With your foundation stone in place, you will spend the last half of this course learning to think probabilistically. You will learn about probability distributions for both discrete and continuous variables, which provide the mathematical foundation for you to draw meaningful conclusions from your data. We will not get mired in mathematical details, but rather will unleash the power of the NumPy random module to use hacker statistics in order to simulate the probabilistic stories and distributions that we encounter. You will find that by writing a few lines of Python code, you can perform even putatively complicated statistical analyses. As you work through this course and its sequel, you will grow ever closer to being able to tell what Tukey calls \"the whole story.\"\n",
