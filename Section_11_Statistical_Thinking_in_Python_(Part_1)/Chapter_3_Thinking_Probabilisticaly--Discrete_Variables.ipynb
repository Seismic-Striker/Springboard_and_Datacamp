Probabilistic reasoning allows us to describe uncertainty.

    "# 1. Random number generators and hacker statistics\n",
    "In practice, we are going to think probabilistically using hacker statistics. You had an introduction to hacker statistics in previous DataCamp courses, and in this course we will greatly extend your expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Hacker statistics\n",
    "The basic idea is that instead of literally repeating the data acquisition over and over again, we can simulate those repeated measurements using Python. For our first simulation, we will take a cue from our forebears. The concepts of probability originated from studies of games of chance\n",

    "1 Image: Heritage Auction\n",
    "5. The np.random module\n",
    "Numpy's random module, a suite of functions based on pseudorandom number generation, will be your main engine for doing this. To simulate a coin flip, we will use the function np dot random dot random, which draws a number between zero and one such that all numbers in this interval are equally likely to occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The np.random module\n",
    "If the number we draw is less than point-5, which has a 50% chance of happening, we say we got heads, and we get tails otherwise. This type of experiment, where the result is either True (heads) or False (tails) is referred to as\n",

    "and then generates random numbers in succession. The same seed gives the same sequence of random numbers, hence the name, \"psuedorandom number generation\". So, if you want to have reproducible code, it is a good idea to seed the random number generator using the np dot random dot seed function.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Simulating 4 coin flips\n",
    "Now, to do our coin flips, we import NumPy, seed the random number generator, and then draw four random numbers. Conveniently, we can specify how many random numbers we want with the size keyword argument. The first number we get is less than one half, so it is a heads, but the remaining three are tails. We can show that explicitly using the less than operation, which gives us an array with the Boolean value True for heads and False for tails. We can compute the number of heads by summing the array of Booleans because in numerical contexts, Python treats True at one and False as zero. We want to know the probability of getting four heads if we were to repeat the four flips over and over again. We can do this with a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Simulating 4 coin flips\n",
    "We first initialize the count to zero. We then do 10,000 repeats of the four-flip trials. If a given trial had four heads, we increase the count. So, what is the probability of getting all four heads? It's the number of times we got all heads, divided by the total number of trials we did. The result is about point-06. Pascal and his friends did not have computers and worked out problems like these with pen and paper. While this particular problem is tractable, pen-and-paper statistics can get hard fast.\n",

Actually, you will probably call functions from this module more than any other while wearing your hacker statistician hat. Let's start by taking its simplest function, np.random.random() for a test spin. The function returns a random number between zero and one. Call np.random.random() a few times in the IPython shell. You should see numbers jumping around between zero and one.\n",

    "# The np.random module and Bernoulli trials\n",
    "You can think of a Bernoulli trial as a flip of a possibly biased coin. Specifically, each coin flip has a probability  of landing heads (success) and probability  of landing tails (failure). In this exercise, you will write a function to perform n Bernoulli trials, perform_bernoulli_trials(n, p), which returns the number of successes out of n Bernoulli trials, each of which has probability p of success. To perform each Bernoulli trial, use the np.random.random() function, which returns a random number between zero and one.\n",

    "# How many defaults might we expect?\n",
    "Let's say a bank made 100 mortgage loans. It is possible that anywhere between 0 and 100 of the loans will be defaulted upon. You would like to know the probability of getting a given number of defaults, given that the probability of a default is p = 0.05. To investigate this, you will do a simulation. You will perform 100 Bernoulli trials using the perform_bernoulli_trials() function you wrote in the previous exercise and record how many defaults we get. Here, a success is a default. (Remember that the word \"success\" just means that the Bernoulli trial evaluates to True, i.e., did the loan recipient default?) You will do this for another 100 Bernoulli trials. And again and again until we have tried it 1000 times. Then, you will plot a histogram describing the probability of the number of defaults.\n",

    "Instructions\n",

    "Seed the random number generator to 42.\n",
    "Initialize n_defaults, an empty array, using np.empty(). It should contain 1000 entries, since we are doing 1000 simulations.\n",
    "Write a for loop with 1000 iterations to compute the number of defaults per 100 loans using the perform_bernoulli_trials() function. It accepts two arguments: the number of trials n - in this case 100 - and the probability of success p - in this case the probability of a default, which is 0.05. On each iteration of the loop store the result in an entry of n_defaults.\n",

    "An empty array can be initialized using np.empty(), with the number of entries specified inside the parentheses.\n",
    "Earlier, you looped over a range of 100,000 values and then n values using for i in range(100000) and for i in range(n), respectively. Here, we need to loop over the number of entries we specified above. While we have 1000 entries, or simulations, we will only be performing 100 bernoulli trials, each of which has a probability of success p = 0.05; these are the arguments that will need to be passed in to the perform_bernoulli_trials() function that was defined in the previous exercise. For each trial, the result should be assigned to the appropriate index of n_defaults.\n",
    "You can plot a histogram using plt.hist(), but remember to specify normed=True in addition to n_defaults.\n",

    "In the last video, we simulated a story about a person flipping a coin. We did this to get the probability for each possible outcome of the story. That set of probabilities is called\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Probability mass function (PMF)\n",
    "a probability mass function (PMF). A PMF is defined as the set of probabilities of discrete outcomes. To understand how this works, consider a simpler story,\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Discrete Uniform PMF\n",
    "a person rolling a die once. The outcomes are discrete because only certain values may be attained; you cannot roll a 3-point-7 with a die. Each result has the same, or uniform probability, 1/6. For this reason, the PMF associated with this story is called the Discrete Uniform PMF. Now the PMF is a property of a discrete probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Probability distribution\n",
    "A distribution is just a mathematical description of outcomes. We can match a story to a mathematical description of probabilities, as we have just seen with the Discrete Uniform distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Discrete Uniform distribution: the story\n",
    "The story we simulated in the last video corresponds to the Binomial distribution. Its story is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Binomial distribution: the story\n",
    "the number r of successes in n Bernoulli trials with probability p of success is Binomially distributed. The number of heads in four coin flips matches this story, since a coin flip is a Bernoulli trial with p = point-5.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Sampling from the Binomial distribution\n",
    "We call the function np dot random dot binomial with two arguments, the number of Bernoulli trials (coin flips) and the probability of success (heads). We get 2 heads out of four. We want repeat the four-flip experiment over and over again. Again, we can specify the size keyword argument, which tells the function how many random numbers to sample out of the Binomial distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The Binomial PMF\n",
    "To be able to plot the Binomial PMF, we'll draw 10,000 samples from a Binomial distribution where we do 60 Bernoulli trials with a probability of success of point-1. If we do this over and over and tally the results, we can plot the PMF. As expected the most likely number of successes is 6 out of 60, but we may expect to get as many as 11 or as few as 1. Unfortunately, while this is a proper way to display a PMF, it is not the easiest to implement with Matplotlib. You'll plot a PMF as a histogram in the exercises.\n",

    "9. The Binomial CDF\n",
    "The CDF is just as informative and easier to plot just as we have done before,\n",
    "\n",

    "Compute the probability mass function for the number of defaults we would expect for 100 loans as in the last section, but instead of simulating all of the Bernoulli trials, perform the sampling using np.random.binomial(). This is identical to the calculation you did in the last set of exercises using your custom-written perform_bernoulli_trials() function, but far more computationally efficient. Given this extra efficiency, we will take 10,000 samples instead of 1000. After taking the samples, plot the CDF as last time. This CDF that you are plotting is that of the Binomial distribution.\n",

    "# Plotting the Binomial PMF\n",
    "As mentioned in the video, plotting a nice looking PMF requires a bit of matplotlib trickery that we will not go into here. Instead, we will plot the PMF of the Binomial distribution as a histogram with skills you have already learned. The trick is setting up the edges of the bins to pass to plt.hist() via the bins keyword argument. We want the bins centered on the integers. So, the edges of the bins should be -0.5, 0.5, 1.5, 2.5, ... up to max(n_defaults) + 1.5. You can generate an array like this using np.arange() and then subtracting 0.5 from the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have already sampled out of the Binomial distribution during your exercises on loan defaults, and the resulting samples are in the NumPy array n_defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instructions\n",
    "70 XP\n",
    "Using np.arange(), compute the bin edges such that the bins are centered on the integers. Store the resulting array in the variable bins.\n",
    "Use plt.hist() to plot the histogram of n_defaults with the normed=True and bins=bins keyword arguments.\n",
    "Show the plot.\n",

    "Hint\n",
    "The bin edges can be computed using np.arange(), going from 0 to max(n_defaults) + 1.5. Be sure to subtract 0.5 from this array and store it in the variable bins.\n",
    "You can generate the histogram with plt.hist(), including the arguments normed=True and bins=bins alongside n_defaults.\n",
    "Label your axes with plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(). Note that we are now plotting the PMF on the Y axis.\n",
    "Show your plot with plt.show()"

    "# 1. Poisson processes and the Poisson distribution\n",
    "In his great book on information theory, statistical inference, and machine learning, David MacKay described a town called Poissonville where the buses have a very erratic schedule. If you stand at a bus stop in Poissonville, the amount of time you have to wait for a bus is completely independent of when the previous bus arrived. In other words, you would watch a bus drive off and another one will arrive almost instantly, or you could be waiting for hours. Arrival of buses in Poissonville is what we call\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Poisson process\n",
    "a Poisson process. The timing of the next event is completely independent of when the previous event happened. Many real-life processes behave in this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Examples of Poisson processes\n",
    "For example, natural births in a given hospital are a Poisson process. There is a well-defined average number of natural births per year, and the timing of one birth is independent of the timing of the previous one. Another example is hits on a website. The timing of the next hit is independent of the timing of the last. There are countless other examples. Any process that matches the buses in Poissonville story is a Poisson process. The number of arrivals of a Poisson process in a given amount of time is Poisson distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Poisson distribution\n",
    "The Poisson distribution has one parameter, the average number of arrivals in a given length of time. So, to match the story, we could consider the number of hits on a website in an hour with an average of six hits per hour. This is Poisson distributed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Poisson PMF\n",
    "Let's take a look at the PMF for this example. For a given hour, we are most likely to get 6 hits, which is the average, but we may get more than ten, or possibly none. You might notice that this looks an awful lot like the Binomial PMF we looked at in the last video. This is because the Poisson distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Poisson Distribution\n",
    "is a limit of the Binomial distribution for low probability of success and large number of trials, ie for rare events. You'll explore this relationship further in the following interactive exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The Poisson CDF\n",
    "To sample from the Poisson distribution, we use np dot random dot poisson. It also has the size keyword argument to allow multiple samples. Let's use this function to generate the Poisson CDF. After that it is the usual procedure of computing the ECDF, plotting it, and labeling axes.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The Poisson CDF\n",
    "The result, predictably, looks like the Binomial CDF we saw in the last video.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Let's practice!\n",
    "Now let's get some experience with the Poisson distribution in the exercises"

    "# Relationship between Binomial and Poisson distributions\n",
    "You just heard that the Poisson distribution is a limit of the Binomial distribution for rare events. This makes sense if you think about the stories. Say we do a Bernoulli trial every minute for an hour, each with a success probability of 0.1. We would do 60 trials, and the number of successes is Binomially distributed, and we would expect to get about 6 successes. This is just like the Poisson story we discussed in the video, where we get on average 6 hits on a website per hour. So, the Poisson distribution with arrival rate equal to  approximates a Binomial distribution for  Bernoulli trials with probability  of success (with  large and  small).
