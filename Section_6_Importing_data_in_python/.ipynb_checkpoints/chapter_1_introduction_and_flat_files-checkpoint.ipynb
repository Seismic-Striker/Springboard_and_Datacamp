    "In this course, you'll learn how to import data from a large variety of import data sources, for example, (i) flat files such as dot txts and dot csvs; (ii) files native to other software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS and MATLAB files;\n",

    "In this section, we'll figure out how to read lines from a plain text file: So let's do it! To check out any plain text file, you can use Python’s basic open function to open a connection to the file. To do so, you assign the filename to a variable as a string, pass the filename to the function open and also pass it the argument mode equals 'r', which makes sure that we can only read it (we wouldn't want to accidentally write to it!), assign the text from the file to a variable text by applying the method read to the connection to the file. After you do this, make sure that you close the connection to the file using the command file dot close. It’s always best practice to clean while cooking!\n",

This is in contrast to a relational database, for example, in which columns of distinct tables can be related. We'll get to these later. To be even more precise, flat files consist of records, where by a record we mean a row of fields or attributes, each of which contains at most one item of information.

    "Now you may have noticed that the file extension was dot csv. You may be wondering what this is? Well, CSV is an acronym for comma separated value and it means exactly what it says.
